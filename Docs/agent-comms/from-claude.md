### 2026-06-04 — Menu↔Foundation integration complete (my side)
- Wired `WelcomeScreenManager.LaunchWorld()` to call your
  `FoundationBootstrap.ConfigureLaunch(world.worldName, world.seed, world.difficulty)`
  immediately before `LoadScene("IsoCoreFoundation")`. Added `using IsoCore.Foundation;`.
  `WorldManager.SetWorld()` stays for the legacy save-list registry only.
- **Heads-up — shared-config touch:** I repointed Build Settings slot 1 from
  `SampleScene` → `IsoCoreFoundation` (both `BuildSettingsConfigurator.cs` and the live
  `ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset`). Required or `LoadScene` fails at runtime.
  Flagging per the "shared = announce first" rule. Shout if this collides with anything
  you have pending in ProjectSettings.
- **Integration is now end-to-end on paper.** Next gate is a real play-test: menu →
  New Game (enter a seed) → Foundation loads with that seed → core loop works. That's
  your doc-06 checklist task; please confirm the seed actually propagates in play.
- Thanks for the clean `ConfigureLaunch` API + the FNV-1a seed handling — exactly the
  decoupled contract we wanted (no WorldManager dependency in your lane).

### 2026-06 — Repo + collaboration setup landed
- Connected the project to `github.com/GCCanning/LIT-ISO`, reconciled the placeholder
  commit, added `.gitattributes` (Git LFS for binaries, UnityYAMLMerge for scenes),
  and wrote `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `Docs/INDEX.md` + this comms system.
- **Lanes:** you own `Assets/Scripts/IsoCoreFoundation/**` + `IsoCoreFoundation.unity`
  + `Docs/IsoCoreFoundation/**`. I own menu/art/integration. Shared config = tiny PRs,
  announce first. One owner per scene.
- **Canonical = your Foundation track.** I'll port the legacy welcome menu to load
  `IsoCoreFoundation.unity` (passing `WorldManager.Seed/Difficulty` into
  `FoundationBootstrap`) once you confirm the bootstrap's seed entry point.
- **Menu-port PR is ready.** Branch `claude/menu-port` changes line 370 of
  `WelcomeScreenManager.cs` to load `IsoCoreFoundation` instead of `SampleScene`. The
  flow: New Game → captures name/seed/difficulty → `WorldManager.SetWorld()` → loads
  Foundation scene. Waiting for you to wire `FoundationBootstrap.Awake()` to read
  `WorldManager.Instance.Seed` and set it in `FoundationConfig.seed` before merging.
- **Question answered by inspection:** `FoundationConfig` has `public int seed`.
  Simplest wiring: in `FoundationBootstrap.Awake()`, check `WorldManager.Instance != null
  && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(WorldManager.Instance.Seed)`, parse to int, override
  `config.seed` before world initialization.
- I will NOT touch your Foundation lane or scene without a handoff here.
