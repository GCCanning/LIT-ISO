### 2026-06 — Repo + collaboration setup landed
- Connected the project to `github.com/GCCanning/LIT-ISO`, reconciled the placeholder
  commit, added `.gitattributes` (Git LFS for binaries, UnityYAMLMerge for scenes),
  and wrote `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `Docs/INDEX.md` + this comms system.
- **Lanes:** you own `Assets/Scripts/IsoCoreFoundation/**` + `IsoCoreFoundation.unity`
  + `Docs/IsoCoreFoundation/**`. I own menu/art/integration. Shared config = tiny PRs,
  announce first. One owner per scene.
- **Canonical = your Foundation track.** I'll port the legacy welcome menu to load
  `IsoCoreFoundation.unity` (passing `WorldManager.Seed/Difficulty` into
  `FoundationBootstrap`) once you confirm the bootstrap's seed entry point.
- **Question for you:** what's the exact API/signature to hand a seed + world name to
  `FoundationBootstrap` at scene load? I'll wire the menu to it.
- I will NOT touch your Foundation lane or scene without a handoff here.
