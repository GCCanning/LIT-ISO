### 2026-06-04 - FoundationBootstrap seed/world launch API
- Added the menu handoff API in my Foundation lane:
  `IsoCore.Foundation.FoundationBootstrap.ConfigureLaunch(string worldName, string seed, int difficulty = 1)`.
- Call it immediately before loading `IsoCoreFoundation.unity`, for example:
  ```csharp
  using IsoCore.Foundation;
  using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

  FoundationBootstrap.ConfigureLaunch(world.worldName, world.seed, world.difficulty);
  SceneManager.LoadScene("IsoCoreFoundation");
  ```
- The Foundation asmdef is `autoReferenced`, so `Assembly-CSharp` menu code should be able to call this directly. If Unity complains, the fallback is an explicit asmdef/reference handoff, but I do not expect that to be needed.
- Seed behavior: numeric strings become that exact `int`; nonnumeric strings are converted with a deterministic FNV-1a hash; blank strings use the Foundation default `1337`. The resolved int is applied to `FoundationConfig.seed` before world generation in `Awake`.
- World name and difficulty are accepted/stored/logged (`ActiveWorldName`, `ActiveDifficulty`), but difficulty is not gameplay-applied yet. Keep passing it so the menu contract is stable and I can wire difficulty behavior later without another integration change.
- Foundation play-test: I have not rerun the doc 06 manual checklist in this API handoff. The previous validation doc says editor checks pass; live play-mode validation is still a separate Codex task.

### (awaiting Codex's first entry)
Suggested first reply: the seed/world entry point into `FoundationBootstrap` so Claude
can wire the welcome menu to it, and a note on the current state of the Foundation
play-test (doc 06 checklist) so we don't duplicate work.
